    <p>Your feedback is essential to us, which is why we award XP for giving it. Telling us about your experience, good or bad, means that we can better understand what is important to you, what we are doing well, and where we need to make improvements.</p>
    <p>Your feedback helps us to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure we pay attention to what makes the event fun for our friends.</li>
      <li>Improve and enhance the Myth experience for everyone involved (players and NPCs).</li>
      <li>Improve the stories we tell and the decisions we make going forward.</li>
      <li>Ensure we remain transparent about improvements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If there is something we are doing well or could do better, we want your constructive feedback. If you didnâ€™t like something? How could we improve upon it in the future?</p>
    <p>Please note: feedback should be related to the event and plots ran during this specific event. If there are concerns in regards to rules, players, cast or decisions made by staff, please email feedback@mythlarp.com</p>
    <p>Some of these feedbacks will post to Discord!</p>
