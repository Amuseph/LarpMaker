    <p>Your feedback is essential to us, which is why we award XP for giving it. Telling us about your experience, good or bad, means that we can better understand what is important to you, what we are doing well, and where we need to make improvements.</p>
    <p>Your feedback helps us to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Make sure we pay attention to what makes the event fun for our friends.</li>
      <li>Improve and enhance the Myth experience for everyone involved (players and NPCs).</li>
      <li>Improve the stories we tell and the decisions we make going forward.</li>
      <li>Ensure we remain transparent about improvements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If there is something we are doing well or could do better, we want your constructive feedback. If you didnâ€™t like something? How could we improve upon it in the future?</p>
    <p class = "h4">Setting Goals</p>
    <p>Defining your character's number 1 goal helps us to better see the direction you're trying to take your character. 
    Keep the World Builders informed as to what your current goal is, the steps you took at the event to achieve that goal, and what you plan to do in the future.</p>
