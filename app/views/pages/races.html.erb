      <h4>Culture</h4>
        <p>Dael’El live in tribes in the forest, although individual elves often wander alone or live in smaller rural settlements. Their culture is very much influenced by the Wildren respect for nature. They consider themselves to be the Wildren’s protectors. Like their Eldar’El cousins, they appreciate the finer things in life, but especially appreciate the natural beauty of the world around them and are curious about new objects. To honor the natural world around them, their jewelry and other finery is mostly made of items found around them and worked with a minimum number of tools. Materials such as grasses, feathers, shells, horns, and soft stones can be worked into baskets, pendants, and other symbolic works of art. They find peace in the wilderness: they will venture into town when they need something but mostly keep to the woods. They are very observant and know when a leaf is out of place. They are exceptional at tracking. They see and hear many things that happen in the forest shadows. They collect knowledge that they overhear, and this fuels their curiosity.</p>
        <p>There have always been those amongst the Dael’El who felt out of place and joined communities. Some want to become more civilized and turn their backs on the woodlands and their traditions. Others are instead inclined to explore the wilds and see how other tribes live throughout the kingdoms. Because of this variation, Dael’El culture combines elements of the old world and modern times.</p>
        <p>The Dael’El in this region tend to stick to the woodlands and watch and listen to what is going on. The shadows of the towns tend to be filled with the watchers of the woods. They are the secret keepers who hear and see everything.</p>
      <h4>Appearance</h4>
      <h5>Mark of Glamour</h5>
        <p>As a remnant of their Fae overlords, elves can use a small amount of glamour to produce markings on the skin to change their physical appearance. In Dael’El, these patterns tend towards earthen tones, vines, animals, or other patterns which further camouflage them into the woodlands.
      Like their Eldar’El cousins, they prefer to keep them conservative, patterning the hairline, cheeks, or some moderate combination. When they reach adulthood, these markings are chosen and become permanent during a cultural ritual. The ritual uses permanent paint to outline their adult markings, otherwise they will fade as they become elders in their tribes.</p>
      <h4>Structure</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Tribal
          <li>Keeper
          <li>Healer
          <li>Warden
          <li>Matriarch
        </ul>
      <h4>Racial Relations</h4>
        <p>Dael’El are an accepting people overall. They enjoy sharing a fire and hearing about others adventures. They are willing to share how they survive in the forest. They are not shy about letting others know where their boundaries are when called for. They freely conduct trade with many races and are intrigued by Dwarves and Sukh, even though these races live off the land in very different ways. Although wary of them, they are tolerant enough of humans. They feel humans lack common sense and seem to find themselves in trouble quite a bit. Half-elves are case by case, whether they are willing to tolerate them. If they seem to have more human tendencies the Dael’El will avoid them.</p>
      <h5>Eldar’El</h5>
        <p>Kin and allies, Dael’El value the Eldar’El as cousins, if particularly dull and frivolous ones. Eldar’El are among the few invited to partake in Dael’El holy days, and some Dale Elves still take pilgrimages to Eldar’El cities and temples as part of the cultural education that gives them insight into other races. They are allies in politics, although in individual interactions many Dael’El will attempt to make jest or crack the vain exterior of a High Elf companion. The Eldar’El get frustrated with the Dael’El’s free thinking, spontaneous joy in life.</p>
      <h5>Wildren</h5>
        <p>Their other allies and neighbors in the wilds, the Wildren are held in Dael’El culture as the highest goal for what their people can achieve by bonding with the natural world. However, the Dael’El also consider themselves much more civilized and mature than the Wildren. They tend to view them as young hearted—although they like to believe this is a well-kept secret, as they believe in maintaining the appearance of equality. They protect Wildren and the woods as a guardian would. In the process, they continue to learn from their constant spiritual connection with the forests and nature.</p>
      <h5>Dep’El</h5>
        <p>The Dael’El are forbidden to interact with the Dep’El. The Tribal elders have forbidden any contact with them at all: no trade, and no celebrations of any kind. If the Dep’El will attend, they must leave. The Dael’El attempt to warn others of the treacherous nature of the Dep’El, constantly referring to them as the ‘Dark Elves’ and condemning their society as barbaric and criminal. They claim the Dep’El are known for taking what they want when they want, with no regard for the health of the forest or of others around them. As the Dael’El see it, the Dep’El’s close-held belief that all is well if the ends support the means led to one of the biggest betrayals in Dael’El history, and they will never forget the scars it has left.</p>
      <h5>Goblins</h5>
        <p>Dael’El find the goblins unnatural. They feel they are tainted by evil and they do not wish to be around them. The Dael’El cannot stand the thought of corrupting their weapons with goblins blood, since they are unsure whether it would destroy them. So, they avoid killing Goblins, but they will try to scare them off if they seem to be settling in too much. They avoid them as much as possible both in town and in the woodlands.</p>
      
      <h4>History</h4>
        <p>There were always those amongst the Elves who felt out of place, inclined to explore the wilds, and see how other tribes live throughout the kingdoms. While there were many who thought this way, talking to others about these “strange notions” would usually result in ostracism if discussed frequently. On an expedition to the Pale Lands, these outcasts would discover the Wildren. Enderion Lathellis, leader, felt the Wildren’s shared ancestry with the Fae. After the expedition ended, Enderion and some of his most trusted friends returned to learn from the Wildren. Over the next few decades, Enderion realized that he and his companions were able to move through the woods with ease and started feeling more at home there than in the elven cities. With this discovery in hand, Enderion started spreading the word of “another way” for elves to live. He invited elves to explore the wilds themselves and see the changes it may enact. In time, he gathered enough interest to gain an audience with hierarchs, where he asked to take those who were not suited to city life and see how they fared in the wilds. To his surprise, the hierarchs agreed to his terms, though the reason why was unclear. Thus, Enderion took his people and left for the Moonfell Wood to establish their first of many colonies.</p>
        <p>While the Eldar’El had fully embraced their fay ancestry, the Wildren had given it up completely, binding themselves to the natural world. The newly established Dael’El found their place between the two: a civilization centered around cultivating a deep understanding of the natural laws in hopes that it would lead to a deeper connection to the world itself. Shortly thereafter, the more studious of the colonists learned the magics of nature and the elements, and those that were more martially inclined adapting to hunting. Led by their first High Keeper Enderion Lathellis, they never forgot their heritage even in their new home. They remained friendly to the Eldar’El and thankful that they were given the opportunity to explore themselves and find a home. In time, other curious members of the Eldar’El left their cities to join the tribes of Dale Elves that were popping up in all the nearby forests, and Dael’El numbers grew. This influx of new voices, desires, and excitement enriched the Dael’El tribes, but it also created tensions with the Wildren.</p>
        <p>After Enderion’s passing decades later, the first full Dale Elf was appointed as High Keeper. Arbelei the Maelstrom was a master of the elements of the natural world and a follower of Ororo, god of elemental storms. Ambitious from the start, Arbelei led the Dael’El to expand into dangerous territories. He saw the young and aggressive Humans as a threat and sought to take a forest that bordered Human territory. In the process of taking the forest, the Dael’El discovered that a few Wildren families resided there. Arbelei’s lust for power directed his warriors to drive them out. These Wildren families alerted other families and tribes in the area as well as the Humans, sparking conflict between the three races. Out of kinship, the Eldar’El advised Arbelei against these actions, but he did not listen. Thus the Eldar’El reached out to these Humans and Wildren in hopes that negotiations would help end the conflict. While the Wildren and Humans were more than willing to make reasonable compromises, it was never enough for Arbelei.</p>
        <p>Many among the Dael’El saw that Arbelei was leading them down a path that would irreparably harm their relations with the Wildren, Humans, and even the Eldar’El. Most of these elves felt obligated to help Arbelei regardless, but a splinter group decided it was time to take action. Going against the wishes and without the blessing of the rest of their people, they assassinated not only Arbelei, but all his children as well. The next High Keeper followed the Eldar’El’s advice in the conflict, easing their tensions with the Humans and Wildren. This new High Keeper also banished this new group of elves, as despite their intentions they had committed an unforgivable act to the Dael’El. This sizable group of “blood traitors” later became known as the Dep’El, and the Dael’El cut all ties to them. As time went on, the Dael’El seemed to be forgiven by the Wildren and Humans, but the elves had not forgotten what pain they had caused. Learning from their mistakes, they found a new purpose and duty: not only to understand and connect with nature, but also to be the bridge between the natural world and “civilized” peoples. The lore that they retained from the Eldar’El and the stories they learned from the Wildren gave them the knowledge they needed to make this possible. The bond that they share with nature keeps them strong and proud.</p>

      <h4>Culture</h4>
        <h5>Religion: The Spider: Idol of the Underdark</h5>
          <p>Though the Dep’El continue to worship the Ennead Lumenari,time in the Underdark has weakened the faith of younger generations, who have turn to an increasingly popular worship of Spiders. Growing numbers of Dep’El have turned to praying to goddesses of the web, asking for protection in the dark, whispers of secrets, or a path to riches. At times, sects of worshippers oppose the Dep’El way of life, and become confrontational. However, most sects of Spider worshippers remain peaceful.</p>
        <h5>The Matriarchy</h5>
          <p>Women take up roles such as advisor, leaders, priestesses, and other professions that require more brain than muscle. Men take up roles such as soldiers and laborers.</p>
        <h5>Expectations</h5>
          <p>Contrary to public opinion, Dep’El are an incredibly collaborative people. They expect any decision made to support the generality, although with the leeway that the ends may justify the means. This has led to what other races may consider extreme being commonplace; some Dep’El would rather self-exile or end their own life rather than fail to serve their community.</p>
          <p>The Dep’El markets are filled with unique goods. Their Underdark civilization has led to the development of new meats, crops, and raw materials than any other race in their quest to simply survive. Their meals tend to be extravagant, though the creatures they come from may not look as such, such as the self-explanatory marsh slugs. Dep’El are particularly fond of the various different types of mushrooms such as wavenstrem, ignire, and uuthli, that are found in the underdark. They harvest silk worms to produce their clothing, as well as dry some of the lichen and fungi they come across to develop more types of clothing. There is a rumor that some Dep’El clothing will glow in the right conditions, but these conditions have yet to be found by surface dwellers (see House Dwerran for more).</p>
        <h5>Rumors</h5>
          <p>The Dep’El have remained outside of the normal stream of trade and economy since their escape to Delvahel. Since their attempts to reconnect with the surface, rumors (likely originating from among Dael’El groups) have spread incessantly as to their savagery, that living in the Underdark has corrupted them, and that they are of a brutal and tasteless culture. They claim that if a Dep’El isn’t trying to outright kill you, then they are lying. While some Dep’El survival measures would be considered drastic by outsiders, these could not be further from the truth, and representatives within Dep’El houses work endlessly to maintain a more accurate image conducive to business and diplomacy for all their people.</p>
      <h4>Appearance</h4>
        <p>In the most distinct difference from their aboveground counterparts, the Dep’El tend to have darker skin, ranging pale gray to shades of purple. Their hair can be any color, though paler colors tend to be the norm, and most often in any shade from blonde to white. They have the ability to glamour and same pointed ears which indicate their begrudging membership of the El race.</p>
        <h5>Mark of Glamour</h5>
          <p>Dep’El of certain statuses often take Glamours on their faces. While monarchs do not ornate themselves in this way (for it is assumed they do not need to), these markings are often associated with one’s house and indicate a status that may not be immediately recognizable but is important to social conduct. Glamours on both cheeks indicate a Royal Jester, looked down upon by most Dep’El (see culture). Glamours along the right temple would be a royal guard, whereas a royal advisor would keep them on the left. A royal suitor would glmaour both temples and their face, making their high status near-impossible to overlook. Should a suitor be removed from their position, their glamours would be left as a reminder of their failure to succeed, and the public would be made aware of the change via public display or announcement so the suitor could not deceive any Dep’El.</p>
        <h5>Clothing</h5>
          <p>Dep’El dress tends to be modest and, particularly when meeting outsiders, as formal as is functional, as they dread the idea of leaving any room for critique or complaint. An abundance of silkworms means many garments are made of this rare material, as well as woven or embroidered designs, and the varying temperatures of the Underdark make layers appealing to all. Many Dep’El combine fitted vests, tunics, and sashes with looser, wrapped pants and fine robes. The neck is considered particularly attractive and is often left exposed, as is also a show of strength; if one so readily bares their throat, they should also be ready to protect it. Depending on the Dep’El’s profession, many choose garments and accessories that either reflect the light (or produce their own), or outfits which blend smoothly into the shadow.</p>
      <h4>Structure</h4>
        <p>Divided into houses (or families), each Dep’El house has a matriarch, who is in turn supported by an adviser and a royal suitor. Each house manages its own area of Dep’El society. Matriarchs of the largest houses gather in the Quelleran.</p>
        <h5>The Quelleran</h5>
          <p>Decisions affecting the whole of the race are decided by holding council meetings, called the Quelleran. Each house’s matriarch comes to the head house’s estate to convene. They meet at least four times a year. They discuss economic development, border disputes, racial tensions, etc during this time. In times of war, they will convene more often, sometimes to multiple times a month. These meetings are heavily guarded by each house’s royal guard. There have been very few attempts of murdering all the matriarchs at once, all have been unsuccessful. Each house helps keep Dep’El society running in one aspect or another. The only responsibility that all the houses share is adding to the military force.</p>
        <h5>Matriarch</h5>
          <p>The head of the family, she leads her house as if it is a small country. Should she fail to properly govern her house (for example, to the verge of economic collapse), she will receive little to no help as it is a failure on her end to govern - unless the collapse of the house would enact any significant damage on the rest of the Dep’El, in which case emergency measures may be taken either to divide the burden amongst other houses or support her for as long as it takes to be certain of continued stability among the rest. Otherwise, the collapse of a house is simply an opportunity for another to rise to power.</p>
        <h5>Royal Suitor</h5>
          <p>Almost all matriarchs a Royal Suitor, the closest any Dep’El can get to a matriarch. The suitor acts as a bodyguard, an advisor, and a lover all at the same time. Many matriarchs hold their suitor’s word higher than their assigned advisor. However, the suitor must also tread far lighter, as a failure to appease could result in a loss of status and even house exile. Once a suitor has been outcast from the house, they may find a living among others, but it is much more likely that they will become convinced they are no longer fit for Dep’El society and flee.</p>
        <h5>Royal Advisor</h5>
          <p>An advisor is usually a female Dep’El who guides the matriarch on ruling her house. They provide a listening ear to walk through problem-solving and offer their own counsel in turn. Chosen through a blood line within the house, if an advisor dies prior to having offspring there is a series of intellectual trials to select a new candidate.</p>
        <h5>Royal Jesters</h5>
          <p>Entertainers to the matriarch, these jesters hold a position of disputable honor. They provide valuable relief and comfort for the matriarch and her house. Some provide culinary services; others music or storytelling; more still comedy. While their value is understood, it is noted that there are many professions that might provide more direct benefit to society, and this is not aided by the self-degradation that can accompany some of the entertainment asked of a Jester. Disdain for those who choose this life, if not the service they provide, is not uncommon.</p>
        <h5>House Allegiances</h5>
          <p>Not all houses are directly represented on the Quelleran. Smaller families instead swear allegiance to certain houses, either because they share similar ideologies or offer some sort of compensation that is better than the others. However, each house still maintains its own symbol and name. In signatures, this allegiance would be indicated by the addition of ‘bound to House…’</p>
      <h4>Houses of the Quelleran</h4>
        <h5>Aurel</h5>
          <p>The house with the most allegiances, Aurel is held in high respect by all due to their ingenuity and lack of xenophobia, a combination of which served to save the Dep’El during the Dael’El crisis. Since then, the Aurel have become the longest-running hosts of the Quelleran.</p>
        <h5>Tiramere</h5>
          <p>House Tiramere worked side by side with the dwarves in the construction of Delvahel. The techniques they learned in this process have since created a notable style of both Elven and Dwarven influences that can be seen throughout Dep’El cities.</p>
        <h5>Javan</h5>
          <p>The first to explore the edible fauna and flora of the underdark, Javan is known for their skilled cooks and cuisine sought by many nobility. They have also developed and maintained something of a monopoly over underground farms since the Dep’El exodus into the Underdark.</p>
        <h5>Dwerran</h5>
          <p>This house has the most skilled tailors among the Dep’El. The first to discover the silkworms in the underdark, they crafted the glowing clothing famous among Dep’El.The silk does not glow by itself, but this is a secret the House has refused to share, even amongst their House’s ever-rotating roster of apprentices.</p>
        <h5>Umberstead</h5>
          <p>Rumored to be the oldest of the houses, Umberstead is held in great respect. However, they are the most xenophobic of the houses. They believe that the Dep’El are better without outside forces and can function as a self-sustaining group.</p>
        <h5>Fr’annas</h5>
          <p>House Fr’annas is the only house to have a patriarch rather than a matriarch. Extensive time and efforts went towards proving their worth to the other houses before they were allowed on the Quelleran, and while their input is frequently discarded and many of their motions undermined, the presence of a male on the Quelleran is a step in a new direction the Dep’El originally thought impossible.</p>
        <h5>Rystran</h5>
          <p>It is a strongly supported rumor that House Rystran, new to much of society, believe that the Dael’Els were in the right. While the talk runs deep, Rystran has yet to confirm or deny any such claims at the risk of losing their new position in the Quelleran.</p>
        <h5>Veruil</h5>
          <p>A quiet house, it is common knowledge that Veruil trains the scouts, spies, and rogues of Dep’El society. They are also known for their adept skill in using mushrooms and mosses to craft effective poisons.</p>
        <h5>Teken’tlar</h5>
          <p>Teken’tlar operates the banks throughout Dep’El society. Their system is an infamously complex layering of loans, collaterals, and other such advanced fiscal measures. They typically only deal with other Dep’El and are known for charging exorbitantly high interest rates for the other races, to the point that many would rather avoid dealing with them altogether.</p>
      <h4>Racial Relations</h4>
        <p>The rumors about their people and their self-prioritization make the racial relations of the Dep’El tricky at best. They are working endlessly to expand trade and diplomacy, but after centuries of self-isolation there have been many hurdles on the road to reconnecting with the outside world, not the least of them from within. They also harbor strong feelings towards Dael’El and half elves (whom they consider to be the product of an elf with low self-esteem), which may be off-putting to potentila mutual allies. It is a work in progress.</p>
      <h5>Dael’El</h5>
        <p>The Dep’El have never forgiven the Dale Elves for forcing them into exile. While they are not officially at war, the Dep’El openly think ill of the Dael’El and refuse to open trade routes with them. Individually, Dep’El tend to use Dael’El as scapegoats for other issues and many will refuse to even share a room with Dael’El.</p>
      <h5>Wildren</h5>
        <p>Their other allies and neighbors in the wilds, the Wildren are held in Dael’El culture as the highest goal for what their people can achieve by bonding with the natural world. However, the Dael’El also consider themselves much more civilized and mature than the Wildren. They tend to view them as young hearted—although they like to believe this is a well-kept secret, as they believe in maintaining the appearance of equality. They protect Wildren and the woods as a guardian would. In the process, they continue to learn from their constant spiritual connection with the forests and nature.</p>
      <h5>Dwarves</h5>
        <p>Suitable craftsman and worthy miners, the dwarves have long held the eye of the Dep’El. They were the first to offer aid during the Dael’El crisis, and together began working on a city made of stone under the crust of the land. They then moved construction to Delvahel, the eventual capital of the Dep’El. Only a small portion of the city exists under the ground. The Dwarves and Dep’El worked for many years to construct this city. The exploration of the Underdark, the survival of the swarming reptiles, and the construction of the city brought the Dep’El and Dwarves close for many years. They have remained close to this day. Dep’El will fight to keep relations with dwarves in good standing, one of the few times who will see a Dep’El noble lose a cool demeanor is when a dwarf is threatened.</p>

      <h4>History</h4>
        <p>All Elves share a common ancestry in the legendary fairy-folk. But while the Eldar’El delude themselves in their beliefs that they are still among the fae and the Dael’El seem to the Dep’El as confused relics of a time long past, their underground counterparts have a long record of being adaptive survivors. Scoffing at the recorded "histories" of the Eldar’El and their claims that they are "closest to the fae," they see the High Elves tales of magic and dancing have little bearing on reality. The cold truth is that the world changed, and so the Dep’El have a pragmatic approach to the lessons of the path, which they feel exist only to inform the decisions of the present and to shape the future. While many believe the Dep’El split from the Dael’El, the fact is the Dep’El always stood a bit apart. Those who would become the Dael’El rejected the pomp and circumstance of the Eldar’El and instead sought to commune with nature. The Dep’El also cast off their more frivolous brethren, but they did so in order to find a more grounded place in their ever changing world, turning their eyes to exploration and commerce.</p>
        <h5>Malestorm’s Rise</h5>
          <p>When the Dael’El were founding their communes, the Dep’El were led by Vaya Alagos to become the most formidable voyagers the world had seen. The success of the Dep’El in exploring their vast new world caused jealousy in the overly ambitious Arbelei Malestorm, leader of the Dael’El, who began to turn his own eyes to expansion. The efforts that followed caused massive strife and conflict among the elves, humans, and Wildren, and the Dep’El implored their woodland cousins to oust the foolish tyrant before they found themselves surrounded by enemies. Indeed, tensions had already grown such that small exploring parties of Dep’El were being slaughtered by humans who couldn not tell the difference between one elf and another.</p>
          <p>Next, the Dep’El went to the Eldar’El, warning them of the trouble that had begun to brew. It was to little avail: the Eldar’El merely advised the Dael’El to stop and would do no more. They would turn a blind eye to the trouble coming and as the Dael’El showed no sign of betraying their leader, the Dep’El chose to formulate their own plan of action.</p>
        <h5>The Assassination & Its Consequences</h5>
          <p>Under cover of darkness, they sent a raiding party into the home of Malestorm and assassinated him and all others in his line, save for the youngest children whom they intended to keep and raise among their own. The new Keeper, however, worried that surviving heirs of Malestorm could threaten his own leadership, and might carry the same traits of their Sire. Hunting down the fleeing assassin band, he had them slaughtered and brought their leader, the voyayer Vaya, in chains along with the bodies of the murdered elflings. Her tongue was cut out so she could be blamed for the murders, and she was executed publicly as a blood traitor. Those who followed her were banished. The Dep’El went first to the Eldar’El, who refused them refuge, then fled to the large island of Delvahel, that had been home to many of their voyagings. Large hollow volcanic mountains yielded huge halls, and they learned to tunnel beneath the surface of the earth to travel swiftly, unnoticed. While many called for revenge, their new leader, Eresse Hissolome urged them to withdraw, rebuild, and never again trust their elven cousins. Dwarves and Dep’El worked together to build a new city deep below the surface, This attempt had to be abandoned after the city came under siege by waves of small reptilian creatures. The races worked together to lock the creatures inside. Construction would be moved to the island later named Delvahel, where Dep’El have remained ever since.</p>

        </ul>
      <h4 class="text-center">Culture</h4>
        <p>Dwarves are a fierce and prideful race, native to Hyraeth’s mountains and mines. They are notoriously trapped between reverence for tradition, and appreciation for adaptability and innovation. They prioritize respect for one another and for the landscape and materials which they utilize. Inherently gifted with metal, stone, and magic, dwarves have long-living clan bonds, dedicated to their kind and their families (either by blood or choice) through even the darkest times. They abide by the idea that with enough ambition and heartiness one can rise to any seat of power, although the old blood that runs throughout the people make this easier to say than do.</p>
      <h5 class="text-center">Religion</h4>
        <p>Many dwarves are faithful servants of Adara or Ryknos, whom they feel represent their kind’s prioritizations of respect, defense, and fairness. It is not uncommon to see dwarves among every god’s faithful, however, for their own clan’s or personal reasonings.</p>
      <h4 class="text-center">Common Professions</h4>
        <p>Dwarves value career paths based on their level of contribution to society. Craftsmanship and battle prowess come first; battlemages, tacticians, crafters, and fighters are among the most popular and highest-regarded paths among dwarven people. They also hold the Fiol’nolnha, a guild which trains bards and collects Dwarven history, in high regard. Dwarves are generally raised into the profession or professions most common among their family, as having clan elders in their hundreds means easy access to an apprenticeship with a master and upbringings among dozens of experts in a single profession often imparts at least some interest.</p>
      <h5>Metalworking</h5>
        <p>With their innate appreciation of metal and stone, it is no wonder many dwarves have at least some experience in the smithy. Many choose to take on trades of weapon or armor craft, while others prefer fine silvers and golds for jewelry. Regardless of their form, Dwarven metal-crafts hold a certain reputation, and each genuine piece is marked with the iconic interwoven knot engraved into all they forge.</p>
      <h4 class="text-center">Appearance</h4>
        <h5>Beards & Facial Hair</h5>
          <p>Dwarven beards are rumored to have developed due to their mining origins where those who kept them had a built-in mechanism to filter the dust and grime. In the years since, beards have become symbolic, representing honor and ancestors. Merchants who trade with humans or the Dep’el may prefer sideburns or light scruff in order to better fit in with their connections. no facial hair at all is considered a sign of dishonor.</p>
          <p>Many Dwarven clans keep braided patterns in both their hair and beards. These may be as elaborate as an entire head knotted into a tapestry-like weave, or as simple as several braids corded with colored thread, but are as unique to each Dwarven family as their own name.</p>
        <h5>Clothing</h5>
          <p>Dwarves prefer armor or other clothes with pronounced geometric shapes, such as the facets of gems. Armor or metal garments may bear stones, gems, or even carved ancestral faces.</p>
      <h4 class="text-center">Structure</h4>
          <p>In societal ranking, all dwarves are assumed worthy of respect until they prove themselves otherwise (although many dwarves are more than happy to explain the difference between respect and acceptance, should need arise); this is not to say that more respect cannot be accumulated, and the actions of one’s ancestors are considered to reflect favorably on their offspring. Contribution is always considered before caste or bloodline, and Thanes assure the people of their worthiness by sacrificing their freedom and independence to serve. Emphasis is put on supporting one’s community through defensive means; and those who pursue careers that may risk their own lives, such as soldiers and battlemages, are considered some of the most honorable within dwarf society.</p>
          <p>Dwarven government is composed of an advisory council, the Vanguard; a representative of the people, the Champion; and an overseer, the Thane.</p>
          <p>The Vanguard is made up of five representatives for trade, labor, war, scholarship and magic, and diplomacy. Appointed to their seats by the ruling Thane upon their taking of the throne, these advisors maintain order at the ground level by reviewing laws and settling petty disputes. Some more radical critics of Khouiel’s government say that the Thane is nothing but a figurehead bound by tradition, while the Vanguard holds the true power and keeps it through bribery and other methods. These claims have been vehemently refuted by the Vanguard itself, but no official action has been taken.</p>
          <p>Chosen through a series of regional competitions, evaluations, and inquiries by the Thane and Vanguard, the Champion is a dwarf of Khouiel or recognized dwarven settlement who can prove that they have made worthy, effective contributions to their people. While in power, the Champion acts as the Thane’s direct representative in diplomatic excursion and in turn represents the Dwarven people in council. A Champion serves for either five or ten years, depending on the Thane’s call. When a Thane dies, all living Champions are called back to Irongate for a week-long tournament process for the Vanguard, the people, and supposedly the gods themselves to determine the next Thane.</p>
          <p>Khouiel’s Thane is seen as the end-all and be-all of law. They are a representative of the people and trusted to do what is best for Khouiel above even their own preferences. Upon their taking of the throne, dwarven clans from across Hyraeth are called to an equal swearing of fealties; where in exchange for bending the knee to the Thane, they in exchange vow to do what is best by the clans, thus establishing the sense of equity and mutual respect that is supposedly built into the core of dwarven leadership. Tradition states that should the Thane ever leave Khouiel, dwarves will fall; as such, the Thane never makes a diplomatic trip beyond the borders of their land.</p>
       <h4 class="text-center">Racial Relations</h4>
        <p>As a general rule of thumb, dwarves are a hearty and friendly enough race that they get along with just about everyone. However, they are also a long-lived species, and in some cases their memory outstretches their kindness.</p>
      <h5>Dep’El</h5>
        <p>The most notable allies of the dwarves are the Dep’El, with whom they have established numerous trade agreements and shared endless projects. Dep’El are permitted into the depths of dwarven mines, where they are welcome to use their talents in order to extract any gems that haven produced. In return, dwarves are given first-pick of the gems mined on Dep’El lands, and the two maintain a short of harmony.</p>
      <h5>Goblins</h5>
        <p>Dwarven clans each have long stories of skirmishes and back-stabbings by Goblins, but these have become infamous for their many contradictions and loose threads. Younger Dwarves tend to treat the Goblins more neutrally, advocating that their elders would be better off focusing on uniting Dwarves rather than fighting about some grave betrayal they can not even remember.</p>
      
      <h4>History</h4>
        <p>Dwarves struggle to record their history, as they didn’t maintain a written language and the long lifespans of their elders meant that oral storytelling has been sufficient in keeping the most notable stories of their people alive. Dwarven clan loyalties and pride mean that many of these stories now have dozens if not hundreds of retellings, some with changes as small as a name pronunciation and others as large as which clans fought for whom in a war. Some contemporary movements to create as truthful a shared narrative as possible have received a mixed reception.</p>
        <p>As far as memory holds, dwarves have always harnessed the resources of the mountains. The oldest songs kept alive recall working deep below the surface, and each range within Khouiel holds its own clan dynamics, many of whom have running feuds over which family has overseen them the longest. It is theorized that once each range, or góra’góradh (literally mountains of the mountains), was run by the head of the largest clan. As these clans merged, made trade, intermarried, and fell, there were fewer and fewer heads, ultimately leading to the first few Thanes of Khouiel. Some of the descendants of these old clans are also said to be the founders of the many guilds in Khouiel and Irongate, including the famous Éguri’s (Smith’s) Union and Adâskei’s (Artificer’s) Union. After the first Thane of Khouiel rose in a supposedly great and glorious battle, they appointed the most notable clans to lead these guilds as a show of respect for their skill. The Temple of Adara and the Temple of Ryknos in Karst Abbey were also established as a means of training honorable children to continue to fight for noble causes.</p>
        <p>The Fiol’nolnha, the order of bardic historians, came about much later, supposedly after a great battle with the goblins that was lost to the tides of time. Since then, they religiously record all political incidents in Dwarven culture. Because Dep’El are also much better record-keepers, dwarves also know that they have been allied with them ever since their exile from El society and helped build not one, but two great cities with their people, one of which had to be abandoned after the Underdark proved too hostile a territory to continue construction.</p>
        <p>Dwarves have been ruled by Thane Seoras for a recorded one-hundred and six years. His rule is notably peaceful, as he prefers diplomatic approaches (particularly ones involving a pint and a barstool) before aggressive ones. He is long-famed for his lengthy negotiations. His Champion, Opyske Axbreak, was appointed within the past two years, and she is rumored to be a far more aloof individual than he. She has spent much of her time on diplomatic travel.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center">Known Settlements</h4>
        <p>Goblins, for the most part, have desired to fit in with the Hyraethian population beyond all else. This has brought them to avoid war and conflict. Due to this, Goblins tend to settle anywhere they can find that is available, or where they won’t feel bad about killing the inhabitants. There are Goblin settlements in numbers too high to count, but those settlements may contain anywhere from 20 Goblins to 200. The settlements tend to not be named and therefore are difficult to keep track of, however Goblins know the names of their own Tribe and the Tribes surrounding them.</p>
      <h4 class="text-center">Culture</h4>
        <p>Goblin appearance does vary, as any other races would. Despite being a created race, the energies used to make these creatures were chaotic, spurring a great variation of beings. Goblins can be found in all shades of greens. They can have any range of facial features; long or short noses, pronounced chins, and big foreheads, but Goblins always have long pointed ears. They can be tall, short, thin, portly, and in many shapes. The average lifespan for a Goblin is around 50 years. This is also greatly dependent on where a Goblin is from. Goblins who grow up mostly in the cities see slightly longer lifespans. Goblins reach physical maturity anywhere from 12-16 years of age. Goblin gestation periods are only about 4-6 months long. Goblin children are usually born between 4-6 pounds and tend to be born in numbers anywhere from 2 to 6 children. Families of Goblins tend to be exceptionally large, nearing 20 Goblins per family depending on village size.</p>
        <p>Most Goblins are born and raised within a Tribe. Tribes range in size and this often depends on access to land. Tribes are hardly hierarchical, with only three officially recognized figures: Chieftain, Elder, and Ritualist. On some occasions these titles may overlap. The remainder of the Tribe are assigned functions within the village based on their family’s specialty. Families pass down skills to their children, causing them to step into a crucial role as their parents age or the Tribe expands. Major functions within Goblin Tribes tend to be as follows, in no particular order: Hunters, Gatherers, Gardeners, Crafts-person, Healers, Trades-persons, and Herders (the people who care for all of the Goblin children).</p>
        <p>Goblins tend to live in whatever they can muster together. Abandoned villages, poorly cobbled together shacks, and tents are the normal for Goblin architecture. On occasion a village will have especially skilled laborers, and their architecture can resemble buildings of those cultures nearby.</p>
        <p>Goblins do not have a unifying language, as Goblin Tribes are as unique as Goblins themselves. This has caused Goblins across Hyraeth to be well versed in the Common tongue. For the same reasons, Goblins do not have their own written language. Goblins communicate with each other through speech and drawings using descriptors to reference items and ideas. A Goblin who does not know the word for shovel might call it a “dirt spoon,” for example.**As an example, if a Goblin does not know the word for "Shovel", they will refer to it as "the dirt spoon" or similar descriptors. Goblins will speak what often sounds like nonsense with their Tribe members but are generally able to understand the words being said. Sometimes these languages sound like unrestrained shrieking, while others take the form of sign language.</p>
        <p>Although misunderstood as being unintelligent or aggressive, this simply is not the truth. It is true, however, that Goblins lack strong language skills, writing skills, and emotional coping mechanisms, all leading to this misconception. What Goblins lack in communication and interpersonal skills, they make up for with a knack for creating trinkets and inventions, an unending pursuit to be happy, and a desire to be better than they were the day before. This does not mean that setbacks or obstacles will not send them into a fury, but this also does not guarantee it. They have as many feelings and emotions as any other race in Hyraeth.</p>
        <p>Goblins tend to be traders and craftsmen and are both spending large amounts of time within their Tribes and experiencing life among other races. This constant change in community causes Goblins to learn about the world around them more slowly, often going back to Goblin ways of living as soon as they return home. Once this happens, Goblins tend to forget the social lessons learned while living among the other races. Those who stay strictly to the lands of the Tribe tend to rarely wander into civilization. The perception is that they are unwelcome, and this fact often causes Goblins to feel like outcasts. All of these reasons contribute to the perception of Goblins as rude, inconsiderate, or stupid. However, Goblins care deeply for their Tribes and their friends. People of other races able to befriend a Goblin find themselves a loyal and reliable friend and ally.</p>
      <h4 class="text-center">Racial Relations</h4>
        <h5>Dwarves</h5>
          <p>When Goblins first immigrated down to Hyraeth, a portion of them settled around Irongate and Crym’s Peak. To this day it is unknown, but something happened between the Goblins and the Dwarves, and they have had strained relationships ever since. Most Dwarves are raised to dislike Goblins, and the story tends to change with each Clan and generation. Goblins, on the other hand, are always bewildered when a Dwarf shows them disrespect.</p>
        <h5>Dale Elves</h5>
          <p>On occasion Goblin Tribes may settle in places of Dale Elf control. In most cases this is no issue, as Goblins are willing to work with the Dale Elves, but in some cases the Dale Elves are offended or may feel pushed out.</p>
        <h5>Deep Elves</h5>
          <p>In the many Goblin attempts to be a part of Hyraeth, they did not often attempt to settle Tribes in the Underdark. On occasion a Tribe may settle near a Dep’El settlement, but there has never been strife.</p>
        <h5>High Elves</h5>
          <p>Knowing Goblins have tried their best to acclimate to a strange and different world, the Eldar’El have grown to pity the Goblins, albeit respecting the work they have put in.</p>
        <h5>Human</h5>
          <p>Human and Goblin relationships vary heavily from region to region. Overall, each race tolerates each other, nothing more. Personal relationships may be found but Human governments are not often engaging in Goblin “politics”.</p>
        <h5>Sukh</h5>
          <p>Sukh, being heavy traders, often rely on Goblin cleverness and ingenuity to enhance the experience of a caravan journey. Sukh and Goblins are often found making business deals and on rare occasions a Sukh may take an abnormally polite Goblins invitation to spend the night at their village as an honored guest.</p>
        <h5>Wildren</h5>
          <p>Wildren’s large capacity for empathy has caused Goblins to often gravitate towards this race. Goblins put a large amount of trust in Wildren due to their ability to be kind and understanding. They often live closely with one another and engage in important local trading.</p>
      <h4>History</h4>
        <p>Goblins came about, ages ago, during the time of The Sorcerium. In preparation for a great war, the Goblins were a creation of pure hate, so that The Sorcerium may know victory. The Goblins fought for this council of Sorcerers for many years, pressing forth, fighting a never-ending war. As time went on it became apparent to The Sorcerium that they had made a fatal error. They could not foresee that beings driven by pure emotion cannot exist. The Goblins began to realize that they could not hate without love. Their anger could not be fueled without joy and their vitriol could not be spewed without pride. Unrest among the armies of Goblins grew, and The Sorcerium began to lose control.</p>
        <p>In the end, The Sorcerium fell to the swords of their enemies, the Goblins leaving them to their fates to seek out new lives. However, this story does not have a happy ending. Though Goblins began to learn the great expanse of emotions, they continued to default to hate in times of challenge and stress. They found that compared to other races they met, they were slow to learn and difficult to communicate with. These frustrations became anger, and they grew to have a nasty reputation. As the Goblins traveled south, they split off into many factions. Across Hyraeth Goblins built up their tribes, direly seeking a place to call home. Over the many years of their expansion, the locals around them grew to trust them, understanding Goblin way of life, and Goblin flaws. The compassion of Hyraethians is unconditional and the Goblin race continues to grow and expand, becoming more advanced and accepted as their time spent with their neighbors grows. They have made many friends and allies and have learned a great deal about the world, even if it takes them a little longer than everyone else.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center">Culture</h4>
        <h5>Acceptance & Attitudes</h5>
          <p>Half-elves are often raised with one side of their family and are as steeped in that culture as possible. Their exposure to religion, understanding of history, political affiliations, and fundamental values will then all be in line with whichever race this happens to be.</p>
        <h5>Dale Elves</h5>
          <p>As a child of the natural world, half Dale elves may find a home among their elven kin. Dale Elves have never placed legal restrictions on their halved offspring, and some families even take in the human parent. Even those who do not take this step often encourage communications between the child and their other family. However, half-elves may experience pressure from their family or clan to help bridge the political gap between humans and elves, and furthermore may still experience discrimination or prejudice from full elves who feel they are not as deserving of their people’s resources.</p>
        <h5>Deep Elves</h5>
          <p>Ever stringent, Deep Elves consider reproducing with a human a sign of low self-esteem among elves. An elf who dares to bring back the offspring of this relationship is held in lower regard and exiled or otherwise punished by their House. The child is then often fostered, adopted, or raised by extended family. They are permitted no knowledge or contact with their human side. Furthermore, they are banned by law from reproducing and highly discouraged from marrying. They are only suitable for menial or simple occupations. The highest a half Deep Elf might strive for among their elven kin would be the position of Royal Jester.</p>
        <h5>High Elves</h5>
          <p>The Eldar’El have maintained a balance of approaches. The child and parent are not openly rejected, although it is not uncommon for the extended family to either give the child away for fostering or quietly disown the parent. The child is permitted knowledge of its human family and allowed to contact them for research purposes as they grow older, so long as the other side is receptive. However, these offspring are considered somewhat weaker than their full-elf counterparts, and are often encouraged to pursue careers in simple labor, religion, or lower levels of scholarship. They are not considered suitable for high academic or military-level work and may be somewhat smothered.</p>
        <h5>Humans</h5>
          <p>Human families are not always thrilled by the appearance of a half-elf child, but have not often strictly prohibited or limited their existence, and they are still considered far more accepting than any of the elven people. Noble and common folk families tend to treat the child as any other born out of wedlock (assuming the parents did not marry); they may send them away for fostering or education, may not tell them of their origins until they are old enough to notice physical differences, or keep it isolated until adulthood. Commonfolk are more likely to accept the elven parent should they be in need of a new home. However, those with prejudices may be more inclined to try and encourage the child to be as human as possible and attempt to reject their elven origins entirely.</p>
      <h4>A Pattern in Personality</h4>
        <p>Split between two worlds, neither of which they fit perfectly into, half-elves tend to develop a strong sense of independence and individualism—although it’s worth noting not every half-elf is truly rejected. In more restrictive situations, some overcompensate, earning further rejection in the process. Others still turn to acts of rebellion as comfort, no matter how small. This may take the form of physical alterations as small as unique piercings to actions as big as openly embracing the culture of one parent to spite the other. Even the most positive from the most accepting families encounter hurdles or prejudice due to their heritage, and it is difficult for them not to become jaded by repeated rejection. More still come to embrace and highlight their individuality: they will never fit in to begin with, so why not embrace it?</p>
        <p>However they express it, half-elves are always different. By choice or force they often become outcasts, pursuing some sense of community where it seems none exists for them.</p>
      <h4>Names</h4>
        <p>Often given names of one of their parents’ cultures (although some are kinder than others), it isn’t unusual for a half-elf to ultimately choose their own. They may take one of a mentor who has been warmer to them than their kin, or of an object they have sentiment towards, or a value they wish to embody. Most families refuse these names, writing them off as the whim of a child who couldn’t know better. It is thus more common for the half-elf to use them once they leave home, hoping to shed behind their often divided upbringings.</p>
      <h4>Professions & Pursuits</h4>
        <p>Some half-elves pick up ancestral or traditional skills in the hope if they succeed in becoming experts at what their people value most, they will be better accepted. This may look like an artificing half Deep Elf, or yet another smith in a human family of smiths. But it is difficult for them to find work in these fields, as competition is high even for their full-blooded peers and if their heritage is known, it provides yet another disadvantage. They often have to move elsewhere in order to find a profession, defeating their original purpose.</p>
        <p>Others decide to forge their own paths early on, pursuing lives as travelling minstrels or thieves. These are often the same half-elves that used magnificent daydreams to escape their less-ideal upbringings, making themselves out as a criminal mastermind or famed storyteller in the making. Not everyone can rise to glory, though, and they usually fall in with common thieves and tavern bards like the rest.</p>
        <p>However they get there, many half-elves will settle into professions that allow them flexibility and travel. The less relevant appearance, the better. If there is the promise of a tight-knit community that allows them a sense of freedom, such as an adventurers’ or thieves’ guild, then they are all the better for it.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center">Scholarship</h4>
        <p>Many, many centuries ago, the Eldar’El’s first forays into scholarly pursuits were fueled by the desire to regain the powers of their Fae ancestors. Eldar’El researched potential Fae weaknesses, the terms of their deals, the limits of their power, and any other path they thought might grant them an upper hand. They were an ambitious, unstoppable people, united by a common goal; but in time their camaraderie began to fray, and the El turned on one another (not for the last time).The crimes committed in this tumultuous time gave way to the Ancient Council, a group of Eldar’El who saw the chance for their people to reunite - this time guided by a shared code. Through their efforts, the first Laws of the Eldar’El were established and their research focuses turned from solely the Fae. Now, many Eldar’El have their own individual motivations for research, fueled by that same passion to understand that drove the Eldar’El in the very beginning.</p>
      <h4 class="text-center">Religion</h4>
        <p>Deities worshiped most by Eldar’El are Amitel, God of the Aether, and twins Adara and Naenya, sun and moon, who are depicted as Elves themselves.</p>
      <h4 class="text-center">Holidays</h4>
        <p>The Eldar’El treat seasonal holidays with the utmost respect. They are a time for gathering and celebration. The Eldar’El will host gatherings that range from feasts with entertainment to formal and costume balls. Holidays are not quite the same in Eldar’El society as in others. Instead of purely religious, times such as Midwinter, Midsummer, and Hallowtide are celebrated by lavish balls or festivals. These balls have various ancient themes and rules that are followed with pride. (As does everything with the Eldar’El.) </p>
        <h5>Midwinter Gathering</h5>
          <p>Midwinter Gathering is goddess Adara’s time. It marks the turning point in the cold season, when the light returns to the land. Celebration of this holiday tends to be casual.  Detailed logistics can be difficult to arrange this time of year; thus, festivities tend to be more laid back than most. This gathering is often considered more joyous than Naenya’s feast, though Eldar’El are very careful to consider both sisters equally.</p>
        <h5>Springtide Celebration</h5>
          <p>Springtide Celebration is a relaxed, yet somewhat formal holiday. It celebrates the shedding of the winter cold into the light air of spring. Wearing of new clothing or other adornment is very popular to help emphasize the rebirth of the year.</p>
        <h5>Midsummer Festival</h5>
          <p>Midsummer Festival is the time of courtship and celebration of love. Though the Eldar’El refrain from expressing emotion, they still take the time to appreciate and experience them. Oftentimes gifts or displays of jewelry, poetry, or magic are shared with their beloved or desired romantic interest. Elaborate masquerades are arranged to pair potential partners.</p>
        <h5>Aventine</h5>
          <p>Aventine is unlike the other holidays as it is more of a time of year. It is the time to celebrate the harvest and finalize preparations for the lean times. The Eldar’El acknowledge this holiday by hosting smaller feasts to recognize visiting travelers and merchants who do not often come to their lands.</p>
        <h5>Hallowtide Ball</h5>
          <p>Hallowtide Ball is traditionally costumed, the intent to hide your identity. The Eldar’El allow themselves this holiday to relax some of their cultural restrictions. A little mischief seems to happen during the celebration of Hallowtide, but rarely do the perpetrators ever get revealed.</p>
        <h5>The Feast of the Waning Moon</h5>
          <p>The Feast of the Waning Moon is known as the goddess Naenya’s time. It marks the arrival of winter. Pragmatism was once necessary for surviving the harsh season. Though this is no longer the case, the feast is still celebrated in the same fashion. A touch of melancholy can be felt this time of year. The time for preparations to survive the lean times has passed, and everyone knows it will be awhile before the Midwinter Gathering arrives.</p>
      <h4 class="text-center">Appearance</h4>
        <p>An Eldar’El is raised from birth to be well spoken, distinguished, and honorable. While an Eldar’El will never tell you a lie, they may not tell you the whole truth either. They are very strategic and meticulous in everything they do.</p>
      <h4 class="text-center">Structure</h4>
        <p>Like all Elves, the Eldar’El have an unmatched eye for beauty in all its forms. Music, art, poetry, dance, and even some forms of martial arts are highly respected and refined in Eldar’El society. There are many rules as to how an Eldar’El should and shouldn’t act. There are decidedly less rules governing general morality. The law itself and one’s ability to justify one’s actions within the letter of the law is more important than vague morality for its own sake. Eldar’El are not as emotionally attuned as their brethren and can seem cold and aloof by comparison. This is thought to be an example of their connection to the ancestral Fairy-Folk.  Being a race quite literally born of the union of Fae and the Aether, wizards and enchanting are the backbone of Eldar’El society. They are the most common class, though not every Eldar’El is one, and skilled and knowledgeable wizards are the most respected members of society.</p>
        <p>Though fighters are recognized as essential, paladins are considered more highly than the commonfighter. A paladin’s oath and binding sense of justice closely mirrors those same values in Eldar’El society.</p>
        <p>One thing that seems surprising to other races is that bards are respected and deemed as essential in Eldar’El society. Beauty and its appreciation are essential to Eldar’El life, and music, poetry,  and storytelling are the most common ways to pursue and appreciate the beauty of life.</p>
      <h4 class="text-center">Government and Economy</h4>
        <p>The Wise Council is the ruling body of all Eldar’El society. Its seven members are elected to their positions, and they provide every law, structure, decree, and major decision that will affect High Elves. Their word is absolute and highly respected. The Wise Council does allow for audiences when any member of society feels strongly about an issue, however the quality, length, and time of this audience is granted based on how much worth the individual can prove based on their accomplishments and reputation in society. Governance is considered the arms of the Wise Council. They are individuals trusted and elected by the Council’s judgment to handle affairs on a smaller scale within communities and towns.</p>
        <p>Masterwork Enchantments are the hallmark of the Eldar’El. No other race has such a connection- or obsession- with the Aether as what is literally in the blood of these Elves. Uncounted generations of Eldar’El have spent their entire long lives in the pursuit of the perfection of this craft, and it is said that a Master Eldar’El enchanter can enchant just about any object to DO anything.</p>
        <p>One other specialty that can only be found with an Eldar’El is the delicate and rare beauty of sea silk. Harvested by a secret process in Siren’s Song Bay, it is the softest and most luxurious silk found in the entire kingdom. Priority on obtaining the material is given to High Elf craftsmen, but its quality is such that you may find those in every region willing to give the coin to obtain it.</p>
      <h4 class="text-center">Racial Relations</h4>
        <h5>Dael’El</h5>
          <p>The Dale Elves are technically, by blood, the same as the High Elves. Both societies recognize this and often put aside their other differences for the sake of family. These Elves will often greet each other as “cousin”, even if they are strangers. The Eldar’El think of their woods-dwelling cousins as like children; rowdy, unrefined, and impatient. They still are family though, and Eldar’El do their best to help their silly cousins. However, the Eldar’El respect the Dael’El’s autonomy, and have never seriously stuck a hand into any matter they believe to be primarily a Dael’El problem. For this reason and few others, no serious discontent has ever arisen between the two groups.</p>
        <h5>Dep’El</h5>
          <p>Deep Elves are another matter entirely. Dale Elves will not speak to one directly, often leaving High Elves to mediate. The Eldar’El have no quarrel personally with the Dep’El. However, their original exile being a matter of serious infraction of the law Eldar’El, find their presence to be somewhat distasteful. Dep’El are not seen as inherently evil, only as lawbreakers and untrustworthy. An Eldar’El would never be blatantly rude to another. So despite how little they have in common and how much they disagree, relations between the two remain amiable.</p>
        <h5>Wildren</h5>
          <p>Though Dael’El seem to be somewhat obsessed with Wildren, Eldar’El retain a healthy respect. Wildren are also born of a kind of Fae, and so despite having nothing else in common, there is a kind of kinship of ancestry felt.</p>
        <h5>Dwarves</h5>
          <p>Dwarves are seen as dependable and useful allies, given their skill sets are different yet complementary to High Elves. Relations are not always smooth sailing, though there has never been any iconic feuds between these races in known history.</p>
        <h5>Humans</h5>
          <p>Humans are fascinating and somewhat dangerous. Unlike any other race, and so short lived, their attitudes and cultures are often quite different than the Eldar’El. Being so short lived allows for quick evolution, and sometimes the Humans’ culture even varies greatly within themselves. Humans make marvelous material for studying.</p>
        <h5>Half Elves</h5>
          <p>Half Elves are not as interesting as Humans, as they are not as suitable as research material and nor are truly Elves. They are not quite as respected as a full-blooded Elf, though they are considered to belong to their Elven parent’s clan. It is very rare for the Elvish parent of a Half Elf to be an Eldar’El.</p>
        <h5>Sukh</h5>
          <p>The Sukh are not very well known to the Eldar’El yet. Though trade routes have been established to Elven lands since ancient times, a comprehensive study of their race has not yet been accomplished and so an official opinion on their race as a whole cannot yet be reached.</p>
        <h5>Goblins</h5>
          <p>Goblins are looked upon by the Eldar’El with pity for their unfortunate existence. Though others often dislike Goblins and will not hesitate to perform violent acts upon them, an Eldar’El does not hate and will not act unjustly against one. Goblins are exploited, miserable, and ugly to boot. They are not really seen as a true race and more as a construct. This is currently a subject of philosophical debate among the Wise Council- what truly makes any race “real” and not merely a construct of some form of magic or circumstance? - but until an answer is reached an Eldar’El will not truly respect a Goblin.</p>
      <h4 class="text-center">History</h4>
      <p>All Elves share a common ancestry in the legendary fairy-folk. But none keep their history quite so meticulously as the Eldar’El. Many have forgotten, but the Eldar’El are the closest to their ancestors. The Eldar’El records shed a (mostly) subjective light on the somewhat mythological origins of Elven kind. The fairy-folk witnessed the birth of a new realm from behind the veil of their own world. Curious, they crossed the veil for the first time. Before the age of man, before dwarves first emerged from underground, the fairy-folk danced on unspoiled earth and wove pure and potent magics. The breath of creation still fresh in this new world enchanted some of the members of the fairy-folk, and as their brethren returned across the veil, these few stayed. The fairy-folk’s blood danced with the rhythm of the magic in this world, and the more magic they did, the more permanently linked to the earth they became. As this world evolved and grew, the fairy-folk evolved and grew. In many ages, they became the Elves. These Elves were of one race, one clan. As other races emerged in this world, the Elves remained as they were- scholars, observers, mages, and cultivators of beauty. Over time, some Elves were not happy with their roles. They rejected such clean-cut finery, the pomp and circumstance, and relentless studying. These restless children eventually gained permission to forever leave the cities and settlements of those they would come to call the Eldar’El, and the Dael’El were born.</p>
      <p>The beginning of the New Age is shrouded in mystery. Even the extensive Eldar’El records tout embarrassing gaps in these ancient times. We do know that in the thirteenth Winter after the war, a new Dael’El leader, Arbeli the Maelstrom, sought to dramatically expand his territory to create a buffer between Dael’El lands and the young and aggressive Humans. This land he sought to acquire was the homeland of Wildren; his reckless ambition sparked conflict between Dael’El and Wildren, Dael’El and Humans, and civil unrest amongst the Dael’El themselves. The Eldar’El Wise Council sought to advise Arbeli against his foolish actions, but he chose not to listen. The Eldar’El do not directly meddle in the affairs of other races, and so because the Eldar’El themselves were not threatened; it was deemed that there was no other action to be taken with Arbeli.  The unrest in the land, however, did threaten Eldar’El- and so they instead sought to mediate peace talks with Humans and Wildren on the behalf of the Dael’El. Arbeli repeatedly broke his word on the agreements reached in these talks and so the Eldar’El rescinded any responsibility for their independent cousins’ actions, refusing any aid until Arbeli would repent for his actions, make peace with the other races, and step down as the ruler of the Dael’El. Some within the Dael’El thought these actions were not enough, and forever changed history with the assassination of Arbeli the Malestrom. Though the leader taking Arbeli’s place followed the suggestions of the Wise Council and was able to make amends with the other races, the assassination itself was stillseen as a forbidden act, and those responsible and who supported it were cast out. Finding no forgiveness with either of their brethren, they became the Dep’El.</p>

      <h5>From Nomadic Origins to Empire</h5>
        <p>As nomads, having first lived amongst the other races with no homeland of their own, the Human race represents an amalgamation of many cultures. Everything from architecture to agriculture reflects the influence of the elder races from where the first Human settlers set down their roots. With no apparent base cultural influence, Humans have borrowed from Hyraeth’s other cultures; Dwarven looking temples and keeps, wrought in stone in defiance of the wooded terrain. Homes and shops built in the styles of the Dael’El to blend into the landscape to give them a pleasing natural look. “This is the way it has always been done,” is not an answer most Humans are willing to accept. They will happily learn anything someone is willing to teach them, but once the lesson is over they take ownership of it. Generally this means experimenting to find ways to improve upon it. Be it art, craft, or magic, Humans find ways to take things further than anyone else would have imagined. Humans their lives in a manner to best suited to blend in with the kingdoms they call home, wherever it may be. While it is rare these days to find a nomadic tribe, it is quite common for Humans to cluster in small villages and hamlets as many of the Human race prefer a more fringe lifestyle similar to the Wildren than packed in together in sprawling cities like the Eldar’El. This does not mean that Humans will not gather in cities as many do, particularly in places like the Attercup Domain and Kingdom of Cantara.</p>
      <h4 class="text-center">Racial Relations</h4>
        <h5>Dwarves</h5>
          <p>They are gruff, short tempered, sometimes rude to a fault, but their skill with metals and stonecraft is unsurpassed. We've learned a lot about stone and steel craft from them. Even managed to impress some of them enough to build that joint settlement where they're making even more advancements in smithing. If you find yourself in a tight situation, you can trust one of them to have your back.</p>
        <h5>Dale Elves</h5>
          <p>While the High Elves still treat us like children, at least their Dale cousins are willing to work with us. A little too militaristic in their worship of the Storm Lord? Perhaps. But their followers of Enoon are sociable enough. It doesn't hurt that they're helping us gain a better understanding of the Wildren and why they seem to hate us.</p>
        <h5>Deep Elves</h5>
          <p>The deep elves are an odd bunch. High Elves walk around with a stick up their backside, acting like their dirt does not stink, but at least you always know where you stand with them. The Dep’El causes many Humans to have an uneasy feeling. Something about them just is not right. I would say it has to do with them living underground, but the dwarves do not give Humans the creeps like these guys do. All that whispering and looking like they are trying to decide if they should kill you or just ignore you.</p>
        <h5>Goblins</h5>
          <p>Human and Goblin relationships vary heavily from region to region. Overall each race tolerates each other, nothing more. Personal relationships may be found but Human governments are not often engaging in Goblin “politics”.</p>
        <h5>High Elves</h5>
          <p>The living conditions under the High Elves were not so bad. Sure they looked down on us, treated Humans like pets, but then, they do that to everyone. They are helpful in the political arena though, so long as you are careful and do not let them sneak in things that benefit only them. They have been helpful in making sure people from the Freelands do not cross over our borders.</p>
        <h5>Half Elves</h5>
          <p>You almost cannot help but to feel bad for these half breeds. The elves reject them as being too Human. If they do not have facial hair, we group them in with the elves. Worse, if they do have facial hair we tend to group them in with us. It is not unheard of to encounter a Human with pointy ears after all.</p>
        <h5>Sukh</h5>
          <p>Shrewd and difficult traders, these cats are! Follow these two rules and you will be fine. Oh! And never sit down to make a deal with them if you have been drinking. You will wind up with more than you needed and a lot less coin to count. I am not trying to say that all of them will take advantage of you, but they do love winning.</p>
        <h5>Wildren</h5>
          <p>I am still not sure what their deal is. Strong connection to the fae and the forests is what I hear. It explains why they seem a little off and are constantly wrapping themselves around trees. I also hear that they hate us for “exploiting” the forests and animals. Well, not all of us can live off moss and grass.</p>
      <h4 class="text-center">History</h4>
        <p>The origins of Humankind are unclear. It is only over the last several centuries that they have learned to keep written records. Many songs and tales in the oral tradition tell of lengthy migrations, oppression and war. It is surmised that the Human capacity of defiance originates with a time of subjugation that they faced in the far-flung past. Tribal and migratory for most of their collective memory, hunting and gathering became an artform to Humans and as they encountered other races they would add bits of their technology and culture to their own. This led to a massive range of tribal differences that have all gone different directions. The Attercup Domain is the first of the settled human lands that grew into a Domain of independent city-states and villages. Others took to sailing the vast interior and exterior seas of Hyraeth, while others stretched out west further and further until there were clashes with some of the natives. </p>

        <h5 class="text-center">Appearance</h5>
          <p>The Wildren are children of the Fae. They are most likely the descendants of the dryad or satyrs of the past. They show hints of their ancestry in their horns, fur, long ears or other such traits like hooves. Their oldest ancestor stories tell of Wildren coming out of The Endless Bramble to make homes for themselves in the nearby trees and far off forests.
          <br>Wildren prefer the company of the forest animals and plants to other races. Even when they venture out to the cities, villages and towns, they always have part of the forest with them (Dried herbs or flowers in their hair or clothes, etc.). They interact with cautious optimism toward new or unfamiliar things. Generally interactions with people in towns or cities are by careful observation.
          <br>The Wildren love to mimic the looks of animals by painting patterns on themselves with fruit juices and clay. They adorn themselves with flowers to display the glory of nature.</p>
        <h4 class="text-center">Structure</h5>
          <p>Wildren refer to themselves collectively as The People of the Forest. They are born into large
            clans and remain in the same clan throughout life. These clans are grouped geographically.
            Some of the larger clan groups are the Northern Wilds clans (including Winterdell, Shadowvale,
            and Mistgarde), the Lightless Thicket clans, the Mythwood clans, and the Oakstout Forest clans.
            Clans are made up of smaller tribes. The name of the tribe to which a Wildren belongs is their
            skin name- the name of their tree species. A Wildren’s full name begins with their personal
            name, then skin name, and then clan name. For example, one might meet a Wildren named
            Gallae, Pine of Winterdell. Wildren tribes refer to themselves as the People of their tree, such as
            the Maple People or Birch People.<br>
            The Wildren have symbolic and religious leaders, referred to as Elders. The People regard
            these Elders as their tree ancestors. Elders of great age are shown the highest respect at all
            times. The gathering of these Elders from all the Clans is called the Kauni (Kah-oonee). The
            Kauni consists of many clans or tribes spending time together, telling stories and sharing goods:
            at this time they deal with serious issues, determine trade routes, bless the seasons, and
            celebrate the departed.</p>
        <h5 class="text-center">Birth-tree</h5>
          <p>At the same moment a Wildren is born, the seedling of a tree breaks the ground for the first
            time. From that point on, the two are bonded through deep magic. When a Wildren dies, their
            essence returns to nature to become part of their tree. Trees usually live longer than their
            Wildren. But if for any reason the Wildrens tree suffers harm, that Wildren feels the effects and
            may die if the damage is severe enough. Wildren are not born knowing the location of their tree,
            but when they come of age, they go to seek it out. Once they find their tree, it determines their
            skin name and adult tribe. As children, they live with the tribe of their parents. But an oak-raised
            adolescent might find that their tree is a birch or maple, rather than an oak, and change tribes.</p>
        <h5 class="text-center">The Root System</h5>
          <p>Though separated by distance, Wildren tribes from different clans who share a skin name will
            treat each other as family. Distant Wildren form bonds and relationships with each other, seeing
            each as a Brother or Sister of the skin. Root tribes provide shelter and support for each other,
            celebrate together, and assist each other in times of need. The tribal obligations and the
            cross-clan sharing of skin names form what is called the root system. This structures The
            People’s relationships, obligations and behaviors towards each other, and this in turn defines
            such matters as who will look after children if a parent dies and who will care for the sick and
            old.</p>
        <h6 class="text-center">The Rowan</h6>
          <p>The Rowan tribe prides itself in guarding the spiritual well-being of the other tribes. Though each
            tribe serves Enoon with their own rituals, the Rowan Tribe takes the lead with inter-tribal rituals
            and celebrations, and provides spiritual leadership for the rare occasions when the whole of the
            Wildren must appeal to the goddess. They remain neutral in most inter-tribal politics, unless
            directed by the goddess to make a stand to one side or the other.</p>
        <h6 class="text-center">The Ash People</h6>
          <p>The Ash tribe celebrates the value of dreams and romance, the beauty of nature, and the circle
            of life. They are unusually gentle and light-hearted. They see the joy in all of the natural
            creatures no matter how big or small. Many are bards and artists, and they value beauty more
            than, say, the timeliness or utility of a completed project. They are unwilling to offend, and tend
            to be easily swayed on divisive issues of inter-tribal politics.</p>
        <h6 class="text-center">The Alder People</h6>
          <p>The Alder tribe focuses on the value of the individual to the strength of the group. They are
            competitive, fond of sports and contests. Off of the playing field, however, they are fiercely loyal,
            and will never abandon a fellow tribesperson. This ferocity and competitive nature can make
            them rash: the tribe is known for leaping to decisions ahead of other tribes or before a proper
            council has been convened.</p>
        <h6 class="text-center">The Willow People</h6>
          <p>The Willow tribe focuses on Wildren history, on stories, and on the cycles of nature and time.
            Shrewd and practical, they find inventive solutions to new problems by relying on their
            knowledge of past ones. However, their interest in the past extends to recent history, and they
            are slow to forgive grudges.</p>
        <h6 class="text-center">The Ivy People</h6>
          <p>This group of Wildren people are mavericks; they are extremely protective of the forest, animals,
          and plants. They are not friendly to others. Other Wildren consider them a poison in the forest
          due to their extremist views. They will kill to protect the forest, and strive to get items stolen from
          the forest back. The only exception they allow is for those who pray to the gods to release the
          essence of the components. The Ivy people will let you be--as long as you do no harm. They
          are always there in the shadows watching over the forest.</p>
        <h5 class="text-center">Celebrations</h5>
          <h6 class="text-center">Salmera (sal-MER-ah)</h6>
            <p>The Day of Gathering. A day to gather fallen acorns and other seeds and to keep them warm in
            a small pouch kept close to the body for the whole of winter.</p>
          <h6 class="text-center">Emtal (EM-TALH)</h6>
            <p>The Day of Growth. A day in the beginning of spring where all the
            plants and animals are returning to their full glory and life. It is
            when the Wildren start to plant the seeds they have protected
            from the winter’s cold chill.</p>
          <h6 class="text-center">Fael (fae-EL)</h6>
            <p>The Night of Clearing. A winter night full of fire. This is a night
            for the Wildren to honor the land by burning dead trees and
            plants to make room for the spring’s new life.</p>
          <h6 class="text-center">Dour (DOO-ur)</h6>
            <p>The Day of Seeding. This is a special day, the day that each
            individual Wildren was born. This day is different for each
            Wildren.</p>
          <h6 class="text-center">Rezidan (REZ-ih-dahn)</h6>
            <p>Every ten years there is a large Ritual celebration that is
            performed to reach out to the Earth Mother, Enoon. During this
            ritual, The People give back the burned ashes of the deceased
            Wildren from the last decade.</p>

      <h4 class="text-center">Racial Relations</h4>
        <h5>Dwarves</h5>
          <p>Wildren respect the Dwarves for their strong attachment to their mountainous
          homeland and their loyalty to clan, but also often find them rather rigid and disrespectful to the
          land.</p>
        <h5>Dale Elves</h5>
          <p>The closest race to the Wildren is the Dael’el. Dael’el generally protect Wildren
          when they have an opportunity, and esteem them, but not-so-secretly see them as less civilized
          than themselves. The Wildren tell stories of the first encounters between the Wildren and the elf
          Enderion Lathellis and his people. The People taught the elves to live by the land, and the
          day-to-day tasks of Wildren life. When the problems with Arbelei began, the Wildren tried to
          compromise to end the feuding between the races. This did little. Arbelei was greedy in the
          taking of land, and soon the Wildren stepped back and many tribes migrated North, leaving the
          Dael’el to handle their own problems.</p>
        <h5>Deep Elves</h5>
          <p>The Wildren value the Deep Elves for their rebellion against the Dale Elves, and
          see their virtues. Because the Wildren avoid conflict, they appreciate moral complexity.</p>
        <h5>High Elves</h5>
          <p>The Wildren know some of the secrets of the High Elves and preserve them in their
          own unwritten oral history of tales and songs. The Willow Wildren, especially, could tell stories
          that show what the High Elves really are and what they have been in the past. The Wildren do
          not dislike the High Elves, though; rather, they have compassion for what they hide from
          themselves and others.</p>
        <h5>Humans</h5>
          <p>If there were a race that the Wildren disliked, it would be the Humans. The Elves and
          Dwarves can respect the forest even when taking from it. Humans do not ask, or respect nature.
          The Wildren are convinced- thanks to years of experience and stories- that humans are only
          interested in expansion, and not in the proper way of things.</p>
        <h5>Goblins</h5>
          <p>Wildren are fascinated by the goblins’ creativity. While they were once distrustful of
          their more chaotic tendencies and the other races’ perceptions of them, they have come to
          notice marked similarities in their family structures and innovative spirit. The two races
          occasionally live in proximity and engage in trade.</p>
        <h5>Suhk</h5>
          <p>While Wildren are far less warlike than the Sukh as a rule, they appreciate their
          attunement to nature and their nomadic wandering and avoidance of city life. Sukh are friends to
          trees, so Wildren treat them with wary friendliness.</p>
      <h4>History and Traditions</h4>
        <p>The Wildren have oral traditions and history in which they pass down through the generations.
        For outsiders to hear a Wildren’s song is an honor. Stories are told to Wildren children at
        bedtime and by the fireside. Their origins reach back beyond the sharing of the first songs to
        time immemorial, and are tied to the very genesis of the trees, flora, and fauna that first
        populated Hyraeth. As they have no written language, the Wildren use symbols and natural
        markers (e.g. crossed sticks, stone cairns, woven stems) to leave messages and hidden signs
        for those who know where to look and how to read them.</p>
        <p>The Wildren are said to have left the Fae Courts to care for the natural world. They know the
        best places of growth in the forest, and the proper ways to ask forest spirits to release their
        attachments before fruits and nuts are taken or picked. They will do anything to keep the forest
        and its creatures safe.</p>
        <p>The Wildren love to frolic in the woods. The one consistent tradition among all Wildren clans is
        their love of woodcraft games that use their natural skills and teach new ones. They work
        together to celebrate the simple joys that only nature can provide, reconnecting with nature for
        one night as a united clan. After the games of the day are completed the great fire is lit and they
        share a moment of silence to honor the fallen and release their souls back to nature. Then
        stories of them begin: these add the departed to the long tradition of oral history that will never
        be forgotten.</p>
