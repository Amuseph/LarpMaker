<p><b>Arrival Time:</b> Unless assisting with set up, all attendees should arrive after 5 PM.
<p><b>Where to go:</b> Once you’ve parked your vehicle in the parking lot, you’ll notice the large building overlooking it (tavern). If you are at game to cast, head to the lower area behind the building and enter the door there. You will check in with whomever is behind the operations table. If you are to be a player, you will be checking in at the upper area, in front of the building. The check-in area is the furthest door from the parking lot.</p>
<p><b>Check-In:</b> check-in is from 5:30-8:30 PM. As a player, you must bring your weapons and armor to check-in. Here they will get safety checked and approved, regardless if they have been approved in past games. You will also sign in, retrieve your currency, and retrieve any between game items here.</p>
<p><b>Unpacking Your Car:</b> It is essential to know that there are no vehicles allowed anywhere but the parking lot while the Game is running. Otherwise, you may drive your car to your cabin if the roads are not muddy. You should verify conditions prior to driving up. The roads are single car width and unpaved.</p>
<p><b>New player Workshop:</b> Our new player Workshop covers game rules. This workshop typically takes place around 8:00 to 8:30 pm on the Friday evening of the event, in front of the tavern building.</p>
<p><b>Game Start:</b> The action at Myth begins at 10:00 pm with the sounding of the town bell. Ideally, NPCs will be in Game Operations and ready to go before 9:30 pm.</p>
<p><b>Late arrival:</b> If you cannot make the window for check-in, late check-in is available after 10 PM (dependent on current plot in game). This is done by going down to the lower area around back of the tavern and entering the door there. Ask for somebody from production to get signed in.</p>
