<p><b>Where to go:</b> Once you’ve parked your vehicle in the parking lot, you’ll notice the large building overlooking it (Pictured above). As an NPC, you can enter through one of the doors on the lower level. The downstairs area is known as Game Operations (Ops). It is where all NPCs operate to make the game story happen.</p>
<p><b>Check-In:</b> Once you’ve entered Game Operations, ask if there is anyone from Member Services around. If no one is available, ask for the Director, Assistant Director, or GM (Game Manager). Anyone can show you where to sign in. Member Services will be able to show you around and get you familiar with the people and the camp.</p>
<p><b>Unpacking Your Car:</b> It is essential to know that there are no vehicles allow on-site while the Game is running. This restriction doesn’t affect NPCs who typically move their gear from the parking lot into the lower level of the tavern building. Work with Member Services for the best time to move your bedding into the common area. Game Check-in takes place in the common area, so setting up bedding usually takes place after this around 9:00 pm.</p>
<p><b>Rules Workshop:</b> Our Rule Workshop covers game rules. This workshop typically takes place around 8:00 to 8:30 pm on the Friday evening of the event.</p>
<p><b>Game Start:</b> The action at Myth begins at 10:00 pm. Ideally, NPCs will be in Game Operations and ready to go before 9:30 pm.</p>
