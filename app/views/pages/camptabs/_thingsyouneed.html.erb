<h4>Food</h4>
<b><p>NPCs</b><br>
Myth supplies all of your meals, snacks, and drinks for the weekend. The menu includes breakfast, lunch and dinner on Saturday and breakfast on Sunday from our cook. There are snacks and beverages available at all times in Game Operations.<br>
While we do our best to accommodate a variety of dietary restrictions, including vegetarian and vegan, it isnâ€™t always possible for us to provide for every need. If you have a very restrictive diet, you may want to consider bringing food options.</p>
