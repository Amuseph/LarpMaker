<p>In addition to sleeping in a cabin, the tavern building or heading home at night, NPCs and Players are welcome to bring a tent to stay outdoors.</p>
<p><b>Modern Tents:</b> Modern looking tents may not be in the gameplay area. Period appropriate tents may be setup in in-game camping areas. If you aren’t sure where you can set up, ask us. We are here to help. </p>
<p><b>Lock Things Up:</b> Do not keep valuables in your tent. Instead, lock them in your vehicle or a large footlocker. Myth is not responsible for lost or stolen items.</p>
<p><b>Electricity:</b> You may be able to run a 50′ – 100′ extension cord from the tavern building to your tent. This option is not guaranteed. Do not use electric heaters in your tent.</p>
<p>Here is a tent-camping checklist with things to remember:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tent (Be sure you have all the necessary poles and stakes)
  <li>Mallet (To secure stakes in the ground)
  <li>Sunshade or tarp
</ul>
