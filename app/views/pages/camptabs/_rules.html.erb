<p><b>Smoking:</b> Our preference is that you smoke in the parking lot, however, if you are unable to make it to the parking lot you may smoke outdoors in the cabin proper area. Please be considerate of the camp and properly dispose of your butts so we may continue to make this option available. Smoking in the woods, cabins or tavern is not allowed.</p>
<p><b>Swimming/Boating:</b> Swimming is not allowed. Please stay out of the ponds and off of boats.</p>
<p><b>Fires:</b> You are allowed to have campfires in designated areas with permission for the GM. This fire MUST be monitored by one person who is not allowed to leave the area or go to Dedrotâ€™s Realm until the fire is out. Please have a bucket of water available to help put the fire out quickly if needed.</p>
