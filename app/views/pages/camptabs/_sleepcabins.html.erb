<p><b>Adventurers Per Cabin:</b> Cabins in these two districts sleep an average of 10 people using 5 twin-sized bunk beds.</p>
<p><b>Electricity:</b> Cabins do not have power. If you need to run a CPAP machine, try to stay in a cabin near one of the bathrooms and run an outdoor extension cord during Mythâ€™s game-off time. If you run power, do not use an electric heater as it may blow a fuse. </p>
<p><b>Heat:</b> These cabins are drafty, are not heated, nor are they insulated. During the cooler months, it is recommended you have the suitable sleeping gear to handle the cold. You are welcome to move to the heated tavern at any time if you feel you will not be warm enough in your cabin. You will need to be out of the inn before the Game starts.</p>
<p><b>Candles:</b> We do not allow the use of real candles or open-flame lamps at Myth. All light must be battery-powered or glowsticks.</p>
<p><b>Mattresses:</b> Bunks all have relatively thin camp mattresses on bunks. We recommend bringing an air mattress if you have one to enhance your comfort.</p>
<p><b>Bathrooms/Showers:</b> Each of the towns have a co-ed bathroom and showers. The bathrooms are older and not co-ed in design. Please use them with that in mind. There are modern bathrooms on the upper and lower floors of the tavern building that are not co-ed. The bathrooms on the lower level of the tavern have modern, clean shower stalls.</p>
<p><b>Refrigerator:</b> The out-of-game side of the tavern has a fridge available to Players and NPCs to store a limited amount of food. Please be considerate of others.</p>
<p><b>Decorations:</b> We encourage you to decorate your cabin to help enhance the Game ambiance.</p>
<p><b>Cleanup:</b> All members of a cabin are responsible for cleaning it up once the event is over. We recommend bringing a trash bag, broom, and dustpan as there is only one per town. Your trash must be disposed of at the dumpster near the tavern.  Before you leave the event, be sure to have your cabin cleared by the individual coordinating cleanup. We will not award points to anyone in a cabin we are forced to clean up after.</p>
