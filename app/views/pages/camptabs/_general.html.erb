<p><b>Sleeping Assignments:</b> When you register for Myth, you may choose what cabin you would like to stay in. All cabins are issued on a first-come-first-served basis. If youâ€™d like your group to take over an entire cabin, it is recommended you have enough people in your group to take up all the slots in that cabin.</p>
<p><b>Sleeping Off-Site:</b> If you are planning to sleep at home, please indicate such on your sleeping arrangements for emergency purposes.</b>
<p><b>Refrigeration:</b> The out-of-game side of the tavern has a fridge available to Players and NPCs to store a limited amount of food. Please be considerate of how much you store, so others have space for things they need to bring.</p>
