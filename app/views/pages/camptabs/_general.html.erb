<p><b>Drop off and Pick Up:</b> As long the ground isn’t muddy, you are allowed to drive your vehicle to your cabin. If the road to your cabin is too muddy you will need to walk your gear to and from your cabin (approximately 1/8 mile).</p>
<p><b>Sleeping Assignments:</b> When you register for Myth, you may choose what cabin you would like to stay in. All cabins are issued on a first-come-first-served basis. If you’d like your group to take over an entire cabin, it is recommended you have enough people in your group to take up all the slots in that cabin.</p>
<p><b>Bathrooms:</b> Each town has its own bathroom/shower units. These bathrooms/showers are used by all regardless of gender. If you are not comfortable with this, there are unisex bathrooms in the lower level of the tavern.</p>
<p><b>Sleeping Gear:</b> Aside from a thin mattress on your twin-sized bunk bed, nothing else is provided for your bunk.</p>
<p><b>Storage:</b> Your out-of-game items should be stored underneath your shared bunk. If there is not enough space under your bunk you may also bring a footlocker. It is recommended you have a lock for your footlocker and store nothing of value in it. Do not store IN-GAME ITEMS under your bunk.</p>
<p><b>Bathrooms:</b> Each district has a co-ed bathroom/shower. During the colder months, these bathrooms are closed to prevent damage to the water lines.</p>
<p><b>Sleeping Off-Site:</b> If you are planning to sleep at home, please let the Director know for emergency purposes.</b>
<p><b>Cleaning Supplies:</b> While there are brooms and dustpans at the camp, there is often only one set for an entire district. You are required to remove all trash from your cabin, sweep it clean, and leave it in better condition than when you arrived. We recommend bringing a trash bag, broom, and dustpan to take care of your cabin without having to wait. Trash must be brought to the dumpster and you must have your cabin checked by the game staff before you leave.</p>
