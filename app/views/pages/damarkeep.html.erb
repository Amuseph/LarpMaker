  <p>Southeast of Ivygate, a small out of the way town rises out of a dense forest. Many tales surround this small collection of buildings around Lake Damar. Many nobles have sought to settle the place, and many have failed. Most recently, in the year 718, Baron Blythe and his daughter tried. We never met the Baron, and when the Baroness Lyra Blythe disappeared, Countess Seabrooke took over as a courtesy. However, the countess soon turned to love and treason, and left the town behind. Many residents soon followed her in leaving, spreading to the four winds. Those that remained faced a harsh uncertain winter. Then King Marielle appointed Cout Amadeo Sebastian Orsini, The Holy See and his advisor, to take custody of the Keep and the town surrounding it. The Count now rules the area. There are also 9 established families in the area, each with their own trade. </p>
  <p>There are many things happening in Damar Keep these days. Roark Galt bought the Dancing Dragonfly, and it is running well. There are tents dotting the yard, and people milling about them as they go about their business. The trails leading away from the tavern are shaded with trees, heading to the forest. In the forest, you might come across the Druid Grove. The animals seem to keep a closer watch here, as do the surrounding trees and plants. You also might come to the Graveyard. A little further up the trail, a large fire circle sits next to a smaller lake. The forest yawns around the area continuing off into the forest. Creatures both friend and foe lie in these woods, and in the town itself. Are you brave enough to meet them?</p>
