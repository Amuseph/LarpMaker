<div class="pagetitle">The Dancing Dragonfly of Damar Keep</div>
The doors to the tavern creek open as you step in from the outdoors into the bustling interior. 
There's the scent of ale in the air, mixed with the ever-present smell of blood and the loud voices making it clear that this is an adventurer's type of place. 
A group speaks in hushed voices over coin and cheeses in one corner of the room, casting suspicious glances at a nearby group of armored warriors discussing their most recent kill. 
At the bar, a man in a muffin cap is leaning to listen to the eager remarks of a pink-haired woman. 
As you enter the room, the air fills with shouts of glee and anger from a group playing dice, one man grumbling as he passes his coins off and downs his drink in the same motion.
<br>
A paladin greets you with a hearty smile. "Welcome to the Dancing Dragonfly friend. Make yourself at home."
<br>
You make your way inside, eager to find glory and your story.
