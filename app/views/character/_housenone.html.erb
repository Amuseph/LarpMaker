Houses are local groups of adventurers that share a common mission and work toward improving their community through their mission. Once registered with the Adventurers Guild, they are given jobs by the local leadership centered around their mission. 
      Their status as a house is dependent on maintaining membership and good standing with the local chapter of the Adventurers guild.
