Guilds are world organizations scattered around Hyraeth. These organizations will setup and sponsor various chapters in cities and towns in the world.
      As long as these chapters maintain membership and adhere to bylaws of the organization, they are allowed to operate within the area. Failure to do so will cause the guild to pull funding and recognition of its local chapter.
      If you would like to join a guild, meet with a representative about setting up a chapter in your community.
